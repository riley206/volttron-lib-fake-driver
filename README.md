The FakeDriver is a way to quickly see data published to the message bus in a format that mimics
what a true Driver would produce. This is an extremely simple implementation of the 
[VOLTTRON Driver Framework](https://eclipse-volttron.readthedocs.io/en/latest/external-docs/volttron-platform-driver/index.html). 
This driver does not connect to any actual device and instead produces random and or pre-configured values.

## Pre-requisite

VOLTTRON (>=11.0.0rc0) should be installed and running.  Its virtual environment should be active.
Information on how to install of the VOLTTRON platform can be found
[here](https://github.com/eclipse-volttron/volttron-core/tree/v10)

## Automatically installed dependencies

* volttron-lib-base-driver >= 2.0.0rc0

# Documentation
More detailed documentation can be found on [ReadTheDocs](https://eclipse-volttron.readthedocs.io/en/latest/external-docs/volttron-lib-fake-driver_docs_root/docs/source/index.html#fake-driver). The RST source
of the documentation for this component is located in the "docs" directory of this repository.


# Installation

1. If it is not already, install the VOLTTRON Platform Driver Agent:

    ```shell
    vctl install volttron-platform-driver --vip-identity platform.driver
    ```

2. Install the volttron fake driver library:

   ```shell
   vctl install-lib volttron-lib-fake-driver
   ```

   To remove it later, use ```vctl remove-lib volttron-lib-fake-driver```.

3. Create configurations for a fake device:

   * Create a file called `fake.config` and add the following JSON to it:

      ```json
      {
           "driver_config": {
              "remote_id": "fake-campus-building-1"
           },
          "registry_config": "config://fake.csv",
          "interval": 5,
          "timezone": "US/Pacific",
          "heart_beat_point": "Heartbeat",
          "driver_type": "fake",
           "publish_depth_first_multi": true,
           "publish_depth_first_all": true,
          "publish_breadth_first_all": false,
           "publish_breadth_first_multi": false
          }
      ```

   * Create another file called `fake.csv` and add the following contents to it:

      ```csv
      Point Name,Volttron Point Name,Units,Units Details,Writable,Starting Value,Type,Notes
      EKG,EKG,waveform,waveform,TRUE,sin,float,Sine wave for baseline output
      Heartbeat,Heartbeat,On/Off,On/Off,TRUE,0,boolean,Point for heartbeat toggle
      OutsideAirTemperature1,OutsideAirTemperature1,F,-100 to 300,FALSE,50,float,CO2 Reading 0.00-2000.0 ppm
      SampleWritableFloat1,SampleWritableFloat1,PPM,1000.00 (default),TRUE,10,float,Setpoint to enable demand control ventilation
      SampleLong1,SampleLong1,Enumeration,1 through 13,FALSE,50,int,Status indicator of service switch
      SampleWritableShort1,SampleWritableShort1,%,0.00 to 100.00 (20 default),TRUE,20,int,Minimum damper position during the standard mode
      SampleBool1,SampleBool1,On / Off,on/off,FALSE,TRUE,boolean,Status indidcator of cooling stage 1
      SampleWritableBool1,SampleWritableBool1,On / Off,on/off,TRUE,TRUE,boolean,Status indicator
      OutsideAirTemperature2,OutsideAirTemperature2,F,-100 to 300,FALSE,50,float,CO2 Reading 0.00-2000.0 ppm
      SampleWritableFloat2,SampleWritableFloat2,PPM,1000.00 (default),TRUE,10,float,Setpoint to enable demand control ventilation
      SampleLong2,SampleLong2,Enumeration,1 through 13,FALSE,50,int,Status indicator of service switch
      SampleWritableShort2,SampleWritableShort2,%,0.00 to 100.00 (20 default),TRUE,20,int,Minimum damper position during the standard mode
      SampleBool2,SampleBool2,On / Off,on/off,FALSE,TRUE,boolean,Status indidcator of cooling stage 1
      SampleWritableBool2,SampleWritableBool2,On / Off,on/off,TRUE,TRUE,boolean,Status indicator
      OutsideAirTemperature3,OutsideAirTemperature3,F,-100 to 300,FALSE,50,float,CO2 Reading 0.00-2000.0 ppm
      SampleWritableFloat3,SampleWritableFloat3,PPM,1000.00 (default),TRUE,10,float,Setpoint to enable demand control ventilation
      SampleLong3,SampleLong3,Enumeration,1 through 13,FALSE,50,int,Status indicator of service switch
      SampleWritableShort3,SampleWritableShort3,%,0.00 to 100.00 (20 default),TRUE,20,int,Minimum damper position during the standard mode
      SampleBool3,SampleBool3,On / Off,on/off,FALSE,TRUE,boolean,Status indidcator of cooling stage 1
      SampleWritableBool3,SampleWritableBool3,On / Off,on/off,TRUE,TRUE,boolean,Status indicator
      HPWH_Phy0_PowerState,PowerState,1/0,1/0,TRUE,0,int,Power on off status
      ERWH_Phy0_ValveState,ValveState,1/0,1/0,TRUE,0,int,power on off status
      EKG_Sin,EKG_Sin,1-0,SIN Wave,TRUE,sin,float,SIN wave
      EKG_Cos,EKG_Cos,1-0,COS Wave,TRUE,sin,float,COS wave
      ```

   * Add fake.csv and fake.config to the configuration store:

      ```
      vctl config store platform.driver devices/campus/building/fake fake.config
      vctl config store platform.driver fake.csv fake.csv --csv
      ```

4. Observe Data

   To see data being published to the bus, install a [Listener Agent](https://github.com/eclipse-volttron/volttron-listener):
   
   ```
   vctl install volttron-listener --start
   ```
   
   Once installed, you should see the data being published by viewing the Volttron logs file that was created in step 2.
   To watch the logs, open a separate terminal and run the following command:
   
   ```
   tail -f <path to folder containing volttron.log>/volttron.log
   ```
